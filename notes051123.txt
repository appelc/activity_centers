Meeting with Julie re: activity center data
------

Takeaways:
- good to try % weeks with detections
- for females and males separately, use only 4NLC
- for all detections together, OK to use all call types
- need a plot to account for effort thru season somehow
- also plot detections at each site thru season to see how it moves and which sites drop off w/ effort

Other data:
- 2020 COA AC: several sites had 5 ARUs at activity centers (1 at center, 4 in each cardinal direction 500m away)
	- this could help refine calling between 0-1 km!
- 2019 COA AC: several sites had 1 ARU only at activity center
- 2018-2022 OLY AC: several sites had 1 ARU only at activity center

- Barred owl data: I haven't incorporated this up yet (ask Julie for help)
- Nesting/roosting map (ask Ray/Julie)

Covariates:
- Habitat (0/1 is it in nesting-roosting at high threshold)
- Effort (recording time)
- Noise
- Nesting attempt (0/1, where Fe/Pair = 0, Nesting/Fledged = 1)
- Barred owls: model-adjusted predicted number of detections

Response variables for GLMs:
- proportion of weeks with detections
- proportion of days with detection
- other...?

Models:
- GLM
	% weeks with detection (all calls) ~ Distance + Habitat (0/1) + Site
	% weeks with detection (Female 4NLC) ~ Distance + Habitat (0/1) + Individual
	% weeks with detection (Male 4NLC) ~ Distance + Habitat (0/1) + Individual

- Occupancy
	psi(Distance + Site + Nesting attempt + Barred owl) p(Distance + Nesting attempt + Noise + Effort)
		*Site and Nesting attempt redundant here?
		*Try with time-varying 'p' to see whether changes thru the season
		*Multistate?

Schedule meeting with Damon, Taal, Julie
- My models
- What is planned

Priorities:
1. Redo GLMMs with %weeks with detections instead of %nights -- combining '21 and '22 into one analysis
2. Make sure all detections are any calls but F and M separately are just FNLC
3. Get covariates for occupancy and write out models --- can we do multistate?
